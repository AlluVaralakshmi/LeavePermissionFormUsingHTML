# LeavePermissionFormUsingHTML
first we need to create a form that consists of 
1.applicant name
2.date
3.Authority: (ex: principal/hod)
4.leave applying for:(reason)
5.leave start date:(user has to choose this date)
6.leave end date:(user has to choose this date)
7.apply:(create button to apply)
then create a inline style for this using class names or ids or tags etc
Use . for class,use # for id,nothing for the elements without any class or id
The elements which doesn't contain any class or id,then the style for these type of elements will apply to entire form whereever we use
the va;idate if the date is less than the today date 
If it is less then displaying the errror essage or dialogue box tht contain "please select the correct date
writing the javascript code for to store entire details in admin page
for this i use a get method to view the details
